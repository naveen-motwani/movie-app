## This includes two application
### one is front end and other is backend. 
### front end is build on angular 
### back end is build on Asp.Net core.


## Run the back end
### Open the visual studio and hit f5 make sure you are running it IIS Express as I have hardcoded the uri if run using kestral it will generate a different URI. URI must be http://localhost:59968.

## Run front end.
### run npm run start on command prompt and you will be able to access the application. 

## Things needs to be done.
### due to time I am not able to complete front end test cases.
